  question: Which of the following best describes the difference between velocity
    and speed?
  category: Projectile Motion
  answers:
  - "Speed is the time rate at which an object is moving along a path, while velocity
    is the rate and direction of an object\u2019s movement.  "
  - 'Speed is the magnitude of the velocity '
  - 'Speed tells us how fast something is moving with direction, while velocity is
    the magnitude of the speeding object. '
  - 'Velocity and speed are both scalar quantities that describe the same aspect
    of motion without direction. '
